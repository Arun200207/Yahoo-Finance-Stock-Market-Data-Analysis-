## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-eda-dashboard.git
cd stock-eda-dashboard

## üì¶ Installation

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment *(Optional but Recommended)*

To ensure a clean Python environment and avoid dependency conflicts, it‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment.

#### üêß Linux / macOS

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate


## üì¶ Installation

### 3. Install Dependencies

After setting up your virtual environment, you‚Äôll need to install the required Python libraries.

#### üîß Using `requirements.txt`

If your project includes a `requirements.txt` file, install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## üì¶ Installation

### 4. Run the Application

Once your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed, you can launch the app locally using the Streamlit CLI:

```bash
streamlit run app.py


## üßæ How to Use the App

Once the application is running, follow these steps to explore stock data:

### 1. üîç Enter a Stock Ticker

- Use the **sidebar input field** to enter a valid stock ticker symbol.
- Examples:  
  - `AAPL` (Apple)  
  - `GOOGL` (Alphabet/Google)  
  - `TSLA` (Tesla)  
  - `MSFT` (Microsoft)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ticker symbols are case-insensitive but must be valid and available on Yahoo Finance.

---

### 2. üìÖ Select a Date Range

- Use the **date selectors** in the sidebar to specify the time period you want to analyze.
- You can explore daily stock activity over days, months, or years.

---

### 3. üìà Analyze the Stock Data

The dashboard displays multiple views and visualizations to help you understand trends and insights:

#### üìÑ Raw Data Table
- View the historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
- Columns include: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, and `Volume`.

#### üìä Summary Statistics
- Displays key metrics such as:
  - Mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each column.
  - Great for a quick statistical overview.

#### üìâ Closing Price Line Chart
- A time-series plot showing the closing price of the stock.
- Helps visualize trends over the selected date range.

#### üîÅ Moving Average Chart
- Apply a **customizable moving average (e.g., 20-day MA)** to the closing price.
- Use the slider in the sidebar to adjust the MA period.

#### üì¶ Volume Traded Bar Chart
- Visualize how much stock was traded each day.
- Can help identify volume spikes during price movements.

#### üîç Correlation Heatmap
- Shows the correlation between all numerical variables (e.g., Volume, High, Low).
- Helps identify relationships or dependencies between stock metrics.

---

### ‚úÖ Example Workflow

1. Enter `AAPL` in the ticker input
2. Choose `2023-01-01` to `2023-12-31` as your date range
3. Set the moving average window to `20`
4. Review the closing price chart and correlation heatmap to detect trends and relationships

---

> üí° Pro Tip: Try analyzing different tickers across sectors (e.g., tech, pharma, energy) to gain broader market insights.


## üåê Deployment

You can deploy your Stock EDA app online using **Streamlit Cloud** in just a few steps.

---

### üöÄ Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

Follow the steps below to host your app for free on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud):

#### 1. üóÇÔ∏è Push the App to GitHub

Make sure your project files are in a public or private GitHub repository. Your repo should include:



---

#### 2. üîó Connect to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to: [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New App"**

---

#### 3. üìÑ Configure App Settings

In the deployment form:

- **Repository**: Select your repo (e.g., `your-username/stock-eda-dashboard`)
- **Branch**: Choose your working branch (usually `main`)
- **Main file path**: Enter `app.py`

---

#### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Ensure `requirements.txt` is Present

Streamlit Cloud uses this file to install dependencies.  
If you don‚Äôt have one, generate it using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

While this Stock EDA app provides useful insights, please be aware of the following limitations:

- **Single Ticker Analysis Only**  
  The app currently supports analyzing only one stock ticker at a time. Multi-ticker comparisons are not yet implemented.

- **Data Source Restrictions**  
  Data is fetched from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library, which can sometimes experience delays or missing data for certain tickers or date ranges.

- **No Intraday or Real-Time Data**  
  The app uses daily historical stock data only. Intraday or real-time updates are not supported.

- **Limited Technical Indicators**  
  Currently, only simple moving averages (MA) are included. Advanced technical indicators like RSI, MACD, or Bollinger Bands are not part of this version.

- **No Export or Download Feature**  
  Data and charts cannot be directly exported or downloaded from the app.

- **UI and Performance**  
  Designed for simplicity; performance may degrade when analyzing very long date ranges or with slower internet connections.

---

> ‚öôÔ∏è These limitations are expected to be addressed in future updates. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
